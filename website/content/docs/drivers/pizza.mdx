# Pizza Driver

Name: `pizza`

The `pizz` driver is used to produce a flat dough disk with tomato sauce,
cheese, and other toppings as defined by the user.

## Task Configuration

```hcl
task "pizza" {
  driver = "pizza"

  config {
    toppings = [
      "tomato sauce",
      "cheese",
      "pepperoni",
    ]

    allow_ketchup = false
  }
}
```

The `pizza` driver supports the following configuration in the job spec:

- `toppings` - A selection of toppings to place in the pizza. If `pineapple` is
  is added the task may fail.
- `allow_ketchup` `(bool: false)` - If set to `true` the pizza is allowed to
  receive ketchup. This may result in heated arguments and discussions.
